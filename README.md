It is difficult to say whether voice neural search is better or worse than other products like Siri, Google Assistant, or Bing, as each system has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, voice neural search has several advantages compared to traditional search methods.

Natural language: Voice neural search allows users to ask questions in natural language, without the need to formulate queries in a specific format. This makes search more intuitive and easier to use.

Speed and efficiency: Voice neural search allows users to quickly and efficiently find the information they need without wasting time typing queries on a keyboard. Additionally, voice search can use contextual information obtained earlier to better understand what the user is looking for.

Convenience: Voice neural search can be used when hands are occupied or when it is inconvenient to type on a keyboard, making it more convenient and easy to use.

Device integration: Voice neural search can be integrated with various devices, such as smart homes, cars, and mobile devices, making it more universal and accessible to users.

Overall, voice neural search has a number of advantages that make it more efficient and convenient to use compared to traditional search methods. However, each user should decide for themselves which system is most convenient and suitable for their needs.
